# Placement-Tracker

The Placement Tracker is a simple and interactive web app that makes the campus placement process easier.
Students can add their details like CGPA and skills, and companies can set their eligibility criteria.
The app then automatically checks which students match the requirements and shows their shortlisted or rejected status on a clear and easy-to-use dashboard.
